## Goals & Requirements
The goal for this assignment was to demonstrate game development techniques including; input, menus, UI, collisions, particles, lighting, etc and their applications using C# and the Unity game engine as taught in the module.


## Project Thinking
I decided to create a FPS shooter as i thought this would be an fun and enjoyable experience and an effective game to be able to achieve all of the assignment criteria. 

I then worked my way down the list of criteria implementing each feature once at a time to allow me to work through the project in a structured, manageable way.


## Key Learnings
This project was an enjoyable experience allowing me to demonstrate my knowledge of Unity and C# as well as allow me to experiment with new techniques that I learnt during the module.
